# ObstacleCourse
There is a lot going on in this game. I appreciate the chaos and really like that there was so much to mess around with. There are 
falling objects, spinning objects, bouncing balls, and stationary blocks. The player is simply required to make it from one end of 
the maze to the other. There is a debug.log in place to ensure that collisions are recognized and counted. I especially liked this 
project because it makes great use of the different shapes that are standard in Unity.
